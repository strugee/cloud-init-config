# cloud-init-config

Recently I found myself creating DigitalOcean VMs a lot. Every time this happened I would have to do some boring tasks to set up my environment.

DitigalOcean has a neat feature where you can paste some data and it will be interpreted by Debian's `cloud-init` package. In this way you can automate a bunch of stuff at system startup - that's what the files in this repo do.

This is almost certainly not useful to anyone else, at least without modification.
